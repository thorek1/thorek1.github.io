								2021 - Leaning against persistent financial cycles with occasional crises <br> with Erling Motzfeldt Kravi, and Yasin Mimir
    							</summary>
    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>
								Should central banks use leaning against the wind (LAW)-type monetary or macroprudential policy to address risks to financial stability? We first assess LAW as a one-off (nonsystematic) policy using an estimated large-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with empirically plausible persistent financial cycles and a stylised regime-switching (RS) framework of occasional crises. We then evaluate policy-rule based (systematic) LAW using an endogenous RS version of our DSGE model with financial crises, effective lower bound (ELB) on interest rates, and an asymmetric LAW policy. Our findings do not support LAW by monetary policy because the costs of depressing the economy in normal times far outweigh the benefits of a less likely and less severe crisis. LAW increases inflation volatility significantly as it amplifies the effects of supply shocks on inflation. It also leads to higher long-run output costs in the case of nonsystematic policy and to a lower mean inflation rate in the case of systematic policy. The latter also results in more frequent ELB episodes due to the lower mean inflation rate it induces. We find that LAW is only advisable if the policymaker cares more about output stability relative to inflation stability or if financial cycles are less persistent, exclusively under systematic LAW. Higher long-run capital requirements in normal times address risks to financial stability better as they reduce the fluctuations in inflation and output considerably.

								2020 - A macroprudential contagion stress test framework <br> with Christian Bj√∏rland
    							</summary>
    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>
								We develop a macroprudential contagion stress test framework to examine how a network of Norwegian banks can amplify a shock to bank capital at the macro level. The framework looks at how fire sales of common asset holdings can lead to valuation losses for banks (indirect contagion), and how recapitalisation of banks can lead to direct contagion. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to quantify contagion-driven systemic risk and to evaluate the importance of the mechanisms in our model. Using data for 22 banks from 2019 Q2 we find that losses due to contagion can reach 2 percentage points (pp) of the banking sector's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio, but most likely losses are around one-fourth of this. The losses result almost exclusively from indirect contagion. Further, we find that losses are high in the cases where banks quickly run into funding problems. We also find that market liquidity and which assets banks' fire sale first (pecking order) are important determinants of the results. Last but not least, losses due to contagion are highly correlated with losses on covered bonds.

								2019 - 'Leaning Against the Wind', Macroprudential Policy and the Financial Cycle <br> with Christoffer Kok
    							</summary>
    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>
								Should monetary policy lean against financial stability risks? This has been a subject of fierce debate over the last decades. We contribute to the debate about" leaning against the wind" (LAW) along three lines. First, we evaluate the cost and benefits of LAW using the Svensson (2017) framework for the euro area and find that the costs outweigh the benefits. Second, we extend the framework to address a critique that Svensson does not consider the lower frequency financial cycle. Third, we use this extended framework to assess the costs and benefits of monetary and macroprudential policy. We find that macroprudential policy has net marginal benefits in addressing risks to financial stability in the euro area, whereas monetary policy has net marginal costs. This would suggest that an active use of macroprudential policies targeting financial stability risks would alleviate the burden on monetary policy to" lean against the wind".

								2018 - Forbearance Patterns in the post-crisis Period <br> with Katharina Bergant
    							</summary>

    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>Using supervisory loan-level data on corporate loans, we show that banks were more likely to grant forbearance measures to the riskiest group of borrowers when they face high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs). Dissecting this phenomenon further, we show that risky borrowers are more likely to get an increase in the overall limit or the maturity, a stop in amortisation, a significantly lower interest rate, or a roll-over of a loan product. As a second step, we look at the effectiveness of this practice where we show that borrowers who received forbearance measures are subsequently more likely to default. Our evidence also suggests negative impacts on the issuance of new loans as high shares of forbearance are negatively correlated with new lending to the same group of borrowers.

    							<summary>Economic consequences of manipulation in commodity markets - Evidence from a DSGE model
    							</summary>

    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>This paper investigates whether the alleged manipulation of aluminium warehouse queues between 2010 and 2014 had an impact on the aluminium market and what the economic consequences are. I use a structural macroeconomic model to find empirical evidence of the impact of the queueing mechanism and estimate the consequences for the economy. Using estimation results of a structural macroeconomic model, I find that storage levels were more rigid in the period where this queueing mechanism was allegedly manipulated. Speculative demand shocks play an important role in explaining aluminium prices and these shocks are found to have negative economic effects. I argue for more transparency of inventory levels and applying the lessons learned from this episode to other commodity markets.

                  <p class="abstract" align='justify'>Using a non-linear dynamical system approach based on Lotka-Volterra dynamics, we construct a monetary and stock-flow consistent macroeconomic model for the Euro Area. The model features endogenous business cycles, variable usage rate of capital and inventories together with non-neutral money, whose creation by the banking sector is endogenous. Wages, aggregate consumption and investment are empirically estimated using a non-linear and non-Gaussian procedure. The model parameters are calibrated and estimated so that they match closely the European Commission's forecast for the Euro Area. Long term simulations reveal a stable cycle over the mid term before convergence towards one of the long-run equilibria.

				    							</summary>

				    							<p class="abstract" align='justify'>
														The first part of our study shows that in a static analysis the currently proposed regulatory framework is not sufficient and for shocks of a size comparable to that of 2007-2009 bailouts would still be needed at the expense of the European taxpayer, even if the Banking Union architecture of 2023 were already in place today. The second part of the study finds that the costs to the economy go much further than the billions necessary to bail out banks. Building on a non-linear dynamic macroeconomic model whose baseline scenario coincides with the Commission‚Äôs forecasts, we estimate the costs at the euro area level of a medium-sized financial shock (-10% losses in banks‚Äô assets compared to 2007-2009) occurring in 2014 at a cumulated loss of EUR 1 trillion in GDP (approximately -9.4% of the 2016 forecast GDP), job losses amounting to 1.91 million (-1.19% supposing a total workforce of 161.3 million according to the model forecast for 2016) and an increase of EUR 51.4 billion in government debt in 2016 (+0.5% of the 2016 forecast debt). Needless to say, the cost would be much higher in the absence of the
resolution pillar of the Banking Union (which is not scheduled to be fully in place until 2023). </p>
<p class="abstract" align='justify'>
The most effective remedy, according to our simulations, is to increase the banking sectors‚Äô equity ratio target to 9% or more and to lower dividends, in order to make the economy more shock-resistant in the medium term. The study does not claim that an equity ratio target of 9% is the optimal value, although we suspect it to be close to the lower bound, below which the purpose of dampening the impact of a significant shock cannot be reached. We show that the cost of implementing this increased equity ratio is more than offset by the reduction in losses caused by a financial shock. In addition, the separation of retail banks from investment banks, euro area deposit guarantees and a review of fiscal policy seem to provide more efficient tools to mitigate the effects of a new crash than what is currently programmed by the European Banking Union project. An augmented Single Resolution Fund (SRF) with more timely implementation would also certainly reduce the cost of a new crash, but would be insufficient to prevent turmoil in the euro area economy.
