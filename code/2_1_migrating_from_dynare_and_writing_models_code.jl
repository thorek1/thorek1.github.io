## Migrating an existing model to MacroModelling.jl from dynare

Let's try to translate the basic new keynesian textbook model from Gali Chapter 3 in it's nonlinear version. We can get the mod file [here](http://www.thorekockerols.eu/models/Gali_2015_chapter_3_nonlinear.mod)

Once we downloaded the mod file we start by loading the package:"
=#

using MacroModelling
using SparseArrays

# Print the current working directory:
pwd()

# Change the current working directory:
cd()


name_of_mod_file_including_path = "Gali_2015_chapter_3_nonlinear.mod"

# The package includes a function to translate model equations and parameters from a dynare mod file into the format for MacroModelling.jl:
import_model(name_of_mod_file_including_path)


# "Now that we translated the mod file have a look at the original mod file and compared with the translated model."


# Let's try to run the model in julia then:
name_of_jl_file_including_path = "Gali_2015_chapter_3_nonlinear.jl"

include(name_of_jl_file_including_path)


# It does not work out of the box. Now have a look at the error message and see if what is written there applies to the model at hand.



# You can make changes to the model either in the newly created file or here:

# Once the necessary modifications are done you can go on and get the steady state. Check the documentation for the relevant function: http://www.thorekockerols.eu/MacroModelling.jl/stable/call_index/



# and plot IRFs. In order to do plots you need to load the StatsPlots package first:
import StatsPlots

# Try to play around with the options of the irf plot command. Check the documentation in the console with: ?<name of command for which you want to see the documentation>


# You can export the model as a mod file as well:
write_mod_file(Gali_2015_chapter_3_nonlinear_fix)

# which looks like this then:
path_to_mod_file = "Gali_2015_chapter_3_nonlinear_fix.mod"

run(`open $path_to_mod_file`)

## Writing your own first model
Let's say you have the following simple real businesss cycle model you want to implement:

$$\begin{align}
K_{t}&=\left(1-\delta\right)K_{t-1} + I_{t}\\
Y_{t} &= Z_{t}  K_{t-1}^\alpha\\
Y_{t} &= C_{t} + I_{t}\\
\frac{1}{C_{t}^\gamma}&=\frac{\beta}{C_{t+1}^\gamma}  \left(\alpha  \frac{Y_{t+1}}{K_{t}} + \left( 1 - \delta \right)\right)\\
Z_{t} &= \left( 1 - \rho \right) + \rho  Z_{t-1} + \sigma \epsilon_{t}
\end{align}$$

with parameter values:

$$\begin{align}
\alpha &= \frac{1}{3}\\
\beta &= 0.99\\
\delta &= 0.025\\
\gamma &= 1
\\
\rho &= 0.7\\
\sigma &= 0.005

# Once you wrote the model try to print the non stochastic steady state, plot IRFs, and the the theoretical model covariance



# Next lets try to calibrate the steady state such that the capital to yearly GDP ratio is 1.66
# Copy the previously written model (both @model and @parameters parts) and do the necessary changes in the @parameters part. Check the help (?) for @parameters
